# cheevo

Cheevos are very important. Why would anyone spend any time at all on a website that doesn't have cheevos? Take it from Bboy360 a man who knows his shit when it comes to cheevos: [cheevos.com](http://cheevos.com)

Right now cheevos.js only displays cheevos, but that's probably enough to de-scrubify your website for now.

## Usage

Add to you page:

    <script src="TODO: unpkg cdn"></script>

Display:

    Cheevo.display({
      icon: "üêª",
      text: "Displayed an achievement"
    });
